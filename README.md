### Abdullah’s Terminal Portfolio

A personal portfolio disguised as a Windows Terminal — because I prefer experiences over plain websites.
Type a few commands, explore my work, and scroll through the story.
Built from scratch with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No templates, no UI kits — just intention :)
